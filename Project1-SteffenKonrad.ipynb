        "\n",
        "Your goal is to train a model using the features in the original dataset that minimizes the RMSE on the validation dataset. While the naïve model achieves an RMS of ~0.26, it is possible to achieve an error of less than 0.08 on the same dataset (extra credit: +5, if you can find a VALID model with RMSE <0.1 :-) ).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Complete the following tasks. \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Check examples in https://www.cs.mu.edu/~keke/dm/data/house.ipynb. Try more features. So far, we only selected a very small set of columns to use in training. You can add more, especially the ones that are intuitively useful, e.g., zip code, area, school district, garage space, etc. Try at least five more attributes. Report what you have done and what you have observed about the RMSE change. Do not include \"Listed Price\" as they may have considered z-estimate (the output of the prediction model). \"Sold On\" should not be used as future sales cannot utilize this information. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data cleaning: There are NAN and outliers sprinkled throughout the dataset. You should find ways to selectively filter and remove them. Summarize how you handle the missing values and outliers. Use one example to show how different strategies (e.g., removing NAN or replacing with some value) affect the final RMSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Task 1 and 2 still use the training data from 2021 (as used in the above example). However, if the training or testing data size becomes too small (e.g., < 1000) due to data cleaning, the model quality assessment is not reliable. You may change the split_data code to get a larger testing data and adjust the covered period to get reasonable data size. \n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Including more training examples: There is a large number of examples in previous years that you can also include. You may try different strategies to include more training data. However, alway keep the house sales between 2021-2-15 and 2021-3-1 as our test data. Reuse the \"split_data\" function with different time_stamps. The best set of features from the task 1&2 might be sufficiently good for this experiment. However, you may also check whether different sets of features may affect the modeling result. Describe what you do and report the RMSE change with different amount of training data (e.g., including the past 1 year, 2 years, ...). \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Finally, describe the best model you get: the features you used, data cleaning strategies, training data size, testing data size, RMSE, and the feature importance of the best model. \n",
        "\n",
        "Suggestion: reorganize the code neatly with functions to reuse pieces of code.\n",

        "**Final Summary:**\n",
        "----------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "In our first attempt at this experiment, all we did was add five more categories to the data frame used to create the train and test data. These categories included Cooling, Heating, Parking, HighSchoolDistrict, and Zipcode. Since most of these were categorical data, we had to convert the values into integer or float types. We first categorized the data and only kept the values in the data frame that were in the top 5 or 6 categories for every column. For example, there were thousands of data entries where the cooling system was that of \"Central Air\" so we deicded to keep those entries and remove entries whose cooling system was only present a handful of times. After doing this, we converted every category into an integer value ussually ranging 1-6 in order to be able to use that data for later RMSE testing. We then removed any rows that had an NA value in any column, leaving 13,033 entries that we deemed usable for RMSE testing. Hence, we began the RMSE test with the standard split data time stamp of 1/1/2021. The program calculated an RMSE value of aprox. 0.15 which is over .1 less than the starting RMSE value. However, we still wanted to branch out and do what we could to acheive an even lower RMSE value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next two attempts we did were experiments of different methods of data cleaning and column adding in order to make our predictor better and output a lower RMSE value. In attempt two, we only included columns Sold Price, Sold On, Year built, Bedrooms, Cooling, Parking, and Zip as our graph in attempt one showed that those columns were the most helpful in training our predictor. We also filled every NA value in every row with 0 instead of removing the rows all together. These methods allowed us to have 37800 rows of data instead of the 13033 rows of data we had in our first attempt. Sadly, even with these new methods of data cleaning, we recieved an RMSE value of 0.1716806776347261, which was lower than what we recieved in our first attempt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Saddened by the outcome, we decided to keep attempt three much simpler and only change two things from the first attempt. All we did was change every NA value in every row to 0 and set the timestamp to 4/1/2020. This left us with 17531 rows of data to work with. We were then presented with an RMSE value of\n",
        "0.1508279943760018. While this value was lower than that in our second attempt, it still is not the best RMSE value we obtained.\n",
        "\n",
        "In attempt four, we did many different versions of data cleaning. We only contained columns Sold Price, Sold On, Year built, Bedrooms, Zip, and Flooring. Including flooring allowed for a new column of data which contained over 2,000 non-estimated values. We then filled every column's NA values, except for Sold Price and and Sold On, with the average value of the column. We then removed every row that contained an NA value in either column Sold Price or Sold On. We also changed the timestamp for the predicitor to 4/1/2020. This left us with 115091 full rows of data for our predictor to use to learn. However, even after all of our attempts at data cleaning, we were left with an RMSE value of \n",
        "0.19101312026171277, our worst so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, this project taught us both a lot about data cleaning and that too much data cleaning can sometimes be a bad thing. We also learned many python coding tricks such as categorizing values in a data frame column and changing NA values in a column into the average of the columns other values. While we were unable to produce an RMSE value lower than 0.1, we were proud to have lowered the original RMSE by as much as we did. Starting from an RMSE value of 0.25932023967250384 and ending with an RMSE value 0.14890043804776348 is definetly nothing to be ashamed of, even if a lot of our attempts to further lower the RMSE value were unsuccesful."
